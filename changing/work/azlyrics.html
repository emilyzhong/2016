				<div id="title">AZ Lyrics Redesign</div>
				<div id="subheadline">I worked in a group of three to create a modern redesign of the song lyrics website, AZ Lyrics.</div>
				<div class="text one">
					As technology connects people over longer distances, face-to-face, in-person communication is becoming more rare and, as a byproduct, more valued. Despite increased communication, the increased distance means more logistical hurdles to overcome in order to meet in person. The goal of this mockup is an application that makes coordinating meet-ups easier for all participants by streamlining logistical configurations into one application, as opposed to a plethoric arsenal. 
				</div>
				<div class="text two">
					Here, I consider the two main types of meet-ups that occur: smaller groups of two to five people and larger groups of more than five. To better my idea of how the application should mold to their differing needs, I analyze their AEIOU: activities, environment, interaction, objects, and users. In each storyboard molded to a scenario for each group, I begin my ideation of what features should be included to make planning easier.
				</div>
				<div class="text three">
					My low fidelity prototype included the features shown to the right, including an event page, a schedule match page, to-do list, maps, and messaging. I used the POP application to better visualize the navigation of the application when using user testing my low fidelity prototype.
				</div>
				<div class="text four">
					Here is my final prototype along with its navigation, created using Adobe Experience Design and Adobe Illustrator. <br> <br> <em><a href = "https://www.behance.net/gallery/45780727/MeetUp">You can find a higher resolution, along with more details about my design process on my Behance here. </a></em>
