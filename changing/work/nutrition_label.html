				<div class="text one">
					More than two-thirds of adults in America are considered to be overweight or obese. While many turn towards treadmills and barbells, it's important not to forget the prewashed salads and fruit smoothies. As a strong believer of the power of education and knowledge, I sought out to redesign the nutrition label so it better informs and convey people of its health benefits and detriments within a quick glance.
				</div>
				<div class="text two">
					When conducting research for my redesign, I considered how three different age groups understood the information on the current nutrition label. I found that those who were younger tended to have less understanding, possibly to less exposure to the nutrition label. Ideally, the nutrition label should be intuitive enough to understand beneficial and detrimental nutrients at first glance, and should be understandable even for younger children to establish healthy habits at a young age.
				</div>
				<div class="text three">
					After many pages of sketches, personas, and ideation, two of which are shown here, I decided on my top ideas. Inspired by graphs that better displayed data trends and the lesser known aspects of nutrition, I focused on representing the distribution of macronutrients, color coding for quicker understanding, serving size/portion control, and a potential QR code to customize the numbers to individual's body measurements and physical activity.
				</div>
				<div class="text four">
					Here is a breakdown of my design, with two layouts for different spacing. Continuing this project, I would like to explore adapting to label size constraints for different packaging, along with researching more about the food industry's influence on the political field's implementation of nutrition labels. Hopefully someday this will catch Michelle Obama's eye. <br> <br> <em><a href = "https://www.behance.net/gallery/45782135/Nutrition-Label-Redesign">You can view more details about the process on my Behance here </a></em>
