                    I did design work for the <a href="https://dailycal.org">Daily Californian</a>, an independent, student-run newspaper that covers UC Berkeley and the surrounding city. Starting in Spring of 2017, I created infographics to accompany articles and promotional social media graphics; I later focused mostly on promotional material such as social media graphics and advertisements.

                <p class="text">I honestly believe I grew the most as a designer creating weekly work under a time crunch and high expectations to meet. I learned a lot about working with a given set of design guidelines, along with the requests of clients. Coming into UC Berkeley, I did not expect to do design from a newspaper, let alone join â€” this experience, and the amount I learned really taught me that design can be taught, learned, and applied nearly anywhere.</p>
